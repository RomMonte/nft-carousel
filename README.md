<p style="font-size:22pt; font-style:italic;">
“There is nothing more beautiful on earth,<br>
Than a face brightened with cheerfulness.”<br>
The Mountain Wreath<br>
Petar II Petrović Njegoš, Montenegrin poet
</p>

<p style="font-size:22pt;">
These visual compositions were created through the digital processing of photographs.
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Associativeness</h2>
<p>
Simularity of worlds. In principles, geometry, imagination… As an impulse… An impulse to discover the many worlds around us. These worlds are found everywhere (walls, trees, bricks, streets…). The possibilities for their visual manipulation are endless.
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Symmetry</h2>
<p>
As an aesthetic asymptote in interiors, architecture, the human face, image… Exclusivity of beauty, humanoid form, life (?)… Symbol of balance, justice… Cosmicness… As an urge…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Geometry</h2>
<p>
As an arrangement of surfaces (composition)… As a law, principle, science, measure…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Forms</h2>
<p>
Like ideas! Infinite, unpredictable, associative… Usable!
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Colors</h2>
<p>
Influence on forms (especially expressiveness), influence on ambiance, affinity… Instant (subconscious) decisions (music)
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Inspiration</h2>
<p>
Returns often. It is provoked by the infinity of forms, colors, availability…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Illusion</h2>
<p>
Everything is an illusion… especially belief in something…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Circus</h2>
<p>
Colours, magic, illusion, playfulness, lights, childhood…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Cabaret</h2>
<p>
Colours, associations, mysticism, play, youth…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Magic</h2>
<p>
It is found in creation itself, in the details, colours, associations, symmetry, and image… In the realization of the simplicity of creating new visual worlds and the infinite possibilities of combining forms…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Instinct and experienceding</h2>
<p>
From experience: don’t rely solely on instincts… Except in art… In art, you must.
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Subconscious</h2>
<p>
A secret! And within it, everything exists.
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkred; font-size:24pt;">Psychotherapy</h2>
<p>
In solitude, in a club, at the computer, feeling broken… I look at pictures, listen to music (really good music)… Despite the troubles, I feel good. And once again, I’m sure it all makes sense—the pictures, the music, the club, and the refusal to surrender…
</p>

<h2 style="color:darkgreen; font-size:24pt;">Logos… Axiom… Idea… Logic… Principle… Trust… Humanism…</h2>

<p style="font-size:22pt; font-style:italic;">
“I am a sick man…. I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man…”<br>
<b>Notes from the Underground</b><br>
<b>F. M. Dostoyevsky</b>
</p>

<p>
I’m Rom Monte (Stop). My life (and financial!) failures border on idiocy (Stop). I have two wonderful daughters, to whom I was a bad father (Stop). I had a wonderful wife, to whom I was a bad husband (Stop). Really bad (Stop). I was also a bad brother and a bad son, probably a bad friend too… (Stop).
</p>

<p>
Everything that has come my way has been intense: love, friendship, frustrations, joy, and ideas…
</p>

<p>
…<br>
I served in the army!<br>
I was an album producer and the manager of a fantastic orchestra of Roma musicians.<br>
I like R&R, jazz, blues, funk, gypsy music, Latin music, classical, and fusions…<br>
…
</p>

<p>
From all of the above, I believe, comes my stylistic indecisiveness, my logic, ethics, instincts, and tastes… and the impossibility of belonging!
</p>

<p>
My knowledge is modest, I rely on intuition…<br>
…

“Honey for the mouth and a cold grip,<br>
Not to mention the young and fiery!”<br>

Compositions offer the possibility for creative use in various directions. They can serve as unique artwork for interiors, book illustrations, posters, and packaging design, and they can also be used in traditional or contemporary digital media. Images encourage associations, making them inspirational for design and characters in comics, cartoons, horror, video games, set designs, appetizers…
</p>

<p>
Pictures can be printed on canvas or paper and then framed as desired. They are provocative and generate interest and comments.
